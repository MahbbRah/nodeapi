# nodeapi
A simple showcase for building REST API with NodeJS + Express

# Install
To install this pull this repo on your local machine and type `npm install` It will automatically get ready things are for you.

# Database
I used here Mongodb. So to checkout this repo you will need to have installed mongoDB on your machine. When you are set you need to create a collections called `users` and on that you will need a `name` object created which will get back to you through api.

# That's it happy hacking!
